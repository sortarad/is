                    </div>
                    <p>One of the most common questions we hear is <strong>“what is a venture studio?”</strong> The definition of a venture studio is that this is a location that aims to create multiple companies in rapid succession. As alluded to above, this model is often referred to as a startup foundry or “parallel entrepreneurship.” In order for something to be classified as a venture studio, there are three separate criteria that the studio must meet. These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The resources of the venture studio are focused on creating startups from the ground up, meaning that there is a lot of time, effort, and dedication focused on working on a project for a certain period of time.
                        </li>
                        <li>The venture studio builds several different startup companies in rapid succession, meaning that they are often working on multiple prototypes at the same time.
                        </li>
                        <li>The venture studio has the infrastructure in place that lends itself to an efficient company-building machine. The venture studio often pools its manpower, technical tools, and skills to build several projects in a year, reusing infrastructure in an efficient manner.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>People often confuse a venture studio with an incubator studio, also known as a business incubator. When comparing a venture studio vs. incubator, an incubator studio typically receives some sort of equity in the business in exchange for capital and expertise. This is a key difference that everyone should keep in mind.
